# Disco Zoo Solver
Interactable puzzle solver for the NimbleBit game Disco Zoo <br>

I made this a browser project to help me learn about JavaScript and HTML (and to a lesser extent CSS). This is meant to be a stepping stone to an autoplayer, but this one is easier. <br>

Because JS doesn't allow local file reads, the data needed to load animals (because I did not want to dedicate a JS file to 7x10 animals) is in a folder using GitHub Pages. <br>

Issues I'm currently focused on:
* Make a grid.
* Save all images to local/repo.
* Display said images.
* Display correct images when button is pressed.

Later on... <br>
* Create matrix of frequency.
* Output frequency (in percentage and using pictures).

Later later on... <br>
* When grid is clicked, rotate through animals selected (or nothing).
* Update grid based on options.
